# nirubench
personal HLE bench

# how does it works
checks one-shot, average, 4/4 correct

I grade each model's problem-solving - I want to see each solution's process.

problems
prac_prob : find the original one
prob1~5 : simple math quiz
prob6~7 : read part of novel and find the answer
(why not prob8 bt prac? cuz prac_prob is easy n end with prob7 is cooler than end with prob8 i guess

else:

q | i don't belive your bench.
a | ok it's just a hobby. just know i spend money on this.
